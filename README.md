# Front-End Course Exercises - Epicode

This repository contains all the exercises and projects I’ll complete during the **Epicode Front-End Development** course. Here, I’ll document my learning journey, challenges, and practical projects as I develop skills in:

- **HTML** - Creating semantic and accessible page structures
- **CSS** - Advanced styling, responsive layouts, and engaging design
- **JavaScript** - Interactive and dynamic client-side programming
- **Frameworks/Libraries** - Introduction to major tools in the industry (such as React or others)

Each folder includes a description of the project/exercise and the steps I followed to complete it, along with explanations and comments in the code for greater clarity.

## How to Use This Repository
This repo serves as both a personal documentation resource and a reference for anyone interested in exploring the hands-on projects completed throughout the course.
