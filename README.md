# Front-End Course Exercises - Epicode

Welcome to my **Epicode Front-End Development** journey! This repository contains all the exercises and projects I complete throughout the course. Here, I‚Äôll document my learning progress, challenges, and practical projects as I build skills in:

- **HTML** - Crafting semantic and accessible page structures.
- **CSS** - Mastering advanced styling, responsive layouts, and engaging design.
- **JavaScript** - Creating dynamic, interactive client-side experiences.
- **Frameworks/Libraries** - Exploring major industry tools like React and others.

Each folder includes a detailed description of the project/exercise, the steps I followed to complete it, and comments in the code for added clarity.
